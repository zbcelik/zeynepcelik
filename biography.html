            <p>“True success is reaching our potential without compromising our values.” – Muhammad Ali</p>
            <p>My Muslim Turkish-Canadian identity makes me a bit different from the majority group in the country I live in. This identity has shaped my ideologies, values, and lifestyle. My goal in life is to serve humanity by working as a journalist, without compromising this part of who I am.</p>
            <p>In high school, when people asked me what I wanted to become when I “grew up,” I would tell them I wanted to do something in the social sciences but didn’t know what exactly. I knew that I didn’t want to sit in an office all day, and I also knew that I didn’t want to do one single job for the rest of my life. In grade 12, when I finally had to apply for post-secondary programs, I decided that I would go into graphic design because it was a hobby that I had been working on for the past couple of years. Soon enough, I realized that I still wanted to study a program which involved at least some social sciences in it, so when I came across the digital journalism program at the University of Ottawa, I saw that it was a huge opportunity. It combined my interest in world issues, graphic design, videography, and photography. By preparing me in all of these areas, this program would also ensure that I didn’t have to do one single thing for the rest of my life.</p>
            <p>From my observations of both the Western world and the Middle Eastern world, I’ve realized that the misrepresentation of certain issues has caused many of the problems in our world today. In Turkey, honest journalism is punished with jail, and in Canada, there is a lack of diverse voice. I’m here to have an impact and I’m here to serve humanity. Even if this means that a single person benefits from my work.</p>
